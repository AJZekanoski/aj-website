      "description": "Bonnie is almost a year old and is simulataneously adorable and terrifyingly ferocious sometimes. Also she is technically Shelby's dog but I consider her mine most of the time and Bonnie seems to agree.\n",

      "contents": "\nBonnieBonnie has many interests and is a very sociable young lady. She is a Belgian Malinois puppy that is sweet when meeting new people and other dogs but at her core she is intensely predatory and quite protective of her mother. Although she knows a large variety of tricks and commands, Bonnie has been known to ignore them if she is not in the mood to work or if her brain is engaged in hunt mode (happens when she sees wildlife).\nHer breed is used extensively in the armed forces because Belgians are very trainable, loyal, and have no fear of death. She demonstrates all of these qualities most days, especially on those few occasions when she has escaped from us on walks and tries to attack cars and trucks driving by. One of her favorite activities is chasing birds on the beach. Although she has killed in the past (one unfortunate gopher), she also has a lovely sweet side. She once played with a pair of tiny frogs very gingerly so as not to harm them and the three of them hopped around together for a bit.\nShe likes wrestling with me because I let her play bite and sometimes bite her back to let her know who’s in charge. My dream for her is to one day join me on pig hunts but there’s a lot more training and a lot less sassy attitude that needs to happen first. All in all, she’s amazing and I have loved every crazy day of being a co-parent of a furry missile with a bear trap on the end.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nShelby and I at Canyonlands NPHello, I’m AJ. I’m a second year Master’s student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. Despite a devastating global pandemic, I’ve loved my time living in Santa Barbara. Mountain biking, hiking, kayaking, and hanging out at the beach has left me with an immense feeling of gratitude for being able to live in such a beautiful place.\nPlatform Holly at SunsetMy work at Bren has been centered around my Group Project: Wild Pig Management Planning at The Jack and Laura Dangermond Preserve. Wild pigs are a destructive invasive species and it’s been exciting and rewarding to work with such great people to develop real solutions that will help our client.\nMe conducting a wild pig coastal access survey at DangermondMy goals for the immediate future are to continue to work on environmental projects that are pressing and get me outside. While I’d love to stay in Santa Barbara, I’m expanding the search area for my first job out of Bren and can’t wait to hit the ground running with important conservation work. I’m hopeful that the future holds a job I enjoy in a place where Bonnie the dog can run and play. I also can’t wait for my first wild pig pulled pork sandwich, stay tuned!\n\n\n\n",
