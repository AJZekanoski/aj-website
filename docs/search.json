      "description": "Bonnie is almost a year old and is simulataneously adorable and terrifyingly ferocious sometimes. Also she is technically Shelby's dog but I consider her mine most of the time and Bonnie seems to agree.",

      "contents": "\nBonnieBonnie has many interests and is a very sociable young lady. She is a Belgian Malinois puppy that is sweet when meeting new people and other dogs but at her core she is intensely predatory and quite protective of her mother. Although she knows a large variety of tricks and commands, Bonnie has been known to ignore them if she is not in the mood to work or if her brain is engaged in hunt mode (happens when she sees wildlife).\nHer breed is used extensively in the armed forces because Belgians are very trainable, loyal, and have no fear of death. She demonstrates all of these qualities most days, especially on those few occasions when she has escaped from us on walks and tries to attack cars and trucks driving by. One of her favorite activities is chasing birds on the beach. Although she has killed in the past (one unfortunate gopher), she also has a lovely sweet side. She once played with a pair of tiny frogs very gingerly so as not to harm them and the three of them hopped around together for a bit.\nShe likes wrestling with me because I let her play bite and sometimes bite her back to let her know who’s in charge. My dream for her is to one day join me on pig hunts but there’s a lot more training and a lot less sassy attitude that needs to happen first. All in all, she’s amazing and I have loved every crazy day of being a co-parent of a furry missile with a bear trap on the end.\n\n\n\n",
